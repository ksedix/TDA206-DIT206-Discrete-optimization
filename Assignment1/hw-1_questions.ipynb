    "*   All solutions to theoretical and pratical problems must be submitted in this ipynb notebook, and equations wherever required, should be formatted using LaTeX math-mode.\n",
    "*   All discussion regarding practical problems, along with solutions and plots should be specified in this notebook. All plots/results should be visible such that the notebook do not have to be run. But the code in the notebook should reproduce the plots/results if we choose to do so.\n",

    "*   All tables and other additional information should be included in this notebook.\n",
    "*   Before submitting, make sure that your Jupyter notebook run on another computer. That all plots can show on another computer including all your writing. It is good to check if your code can run here: https://colab.research.google.com.\n"
