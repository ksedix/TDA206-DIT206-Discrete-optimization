In order for an LP to be integral, the constraint matrix needs to be a TU(Totally Unimodular) matrix and the constraint vector need to be integral. We have 2 constraint vectors, s and d. Both s and d are integral so that condition is satisfied. Our constraint matrix, lets call it $M$, is what we multiply by x. In the case of our supply constraints, the inequality becomes $M_{1}x \\leq s$. In the case of our demand constraints, we use another constraint Matrix, lets call it $M_{2}$.

The selected interpreters form a vertex cover if they cover all of the languages, i.e the languages spoken by all of the interpreters combined includes all of the languages from A to F. Hence, the languages are the edges that needs to be covered in this case. However, these edges do not have to have size 2. For example, a language could be covered by 2 vertices or by only 1 vertex. Take the language E and F for example. They are only covered by the vertex T. Hence, the edge would be an edge with only 1 element, which is T. The language B is covered by 2 vertices, O and R, so it is an egde with 2 vertices, i.e. {O,R}."
