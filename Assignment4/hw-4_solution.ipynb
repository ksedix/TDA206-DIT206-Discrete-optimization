    "**a)** If we have a triangle graph where each pair of vertices is connected to each other, we can call the vertices $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$. We can say that $z_1=1$, $z_2=-1$ and $z_3=-1$. This means that the vertices are partitioned into 2 sets and Vertex 1 belongs to $S$ and vertex 2 and 3 belong to $V\\setminus S$. We can then formulate the sdp as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} \\frac{1 - z_i z_j}{2} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad z_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The value of the cut is 2, since there are 2 edges that go between the 2 sets in the partition. In fact, no matter how we partition the vertices in the triangle graph into 2 sets, the value of the cut will be 2. So 2 is the value of the maximum as well as the minimum cut in the triangle graph."

    "**b)** The SDP relaxation refers to using vector variables $x_{ij}=u_i^T u_j$ instead of scalar variables $z_i$. The only constraint is that $x_{ii}=1$ which means that the vector variables $u_i$ are unit vectors, since only unit vector multiplied by itself is 1. The SDP relaxation is written as:\n",
